# Personal Portfolio/Blog

This is the website of my personal portfolio/website and blog. You can access it at [jkem.xyz](https://jkem.xyz).

## Framework Used

The site is built using Svelte and SvelteKit. The official documentation for both these frameworks can be found at [svelte.dev](https://svelte.dev/) and [kit.svelte.dev](https://kit.svelte.dev/), respectively. Also, I've used Shadcn-svelte from [shadcn-svelte.com](https://www.shadcn-svelte.com) to give the site a modern look and feel.

## Content Management

To dynamically fetch posts on my blog, I use Directus, an open-source headless content management system (CMS). You can visit their website at [directus.io](https://directus.io/). The site is self-hosted and all content is managed through the Directus dashboard.

## Hosting & Deployment

The entire site is hosted on Hetzner using Coolify, a popular open-source platform for deploying applications. You can learn more about Coolify at [coolify.io](https://coolify.io/).
